# RavensOne Guide

Welcome to the living guide for the RavensOne language and toolchain. This guide complements the root `README.md` by diving deeper into concepts and hands-on workflows.

## Start Here

- [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) — install the CLI, create a workspace, and run your first compile.
- [5-minute tutorial](./tutorial-5-minutes.md) — walk through `raven init`, editing a component, and building output assets.
- [Concepts](./concepts.md) — learn how the lexer, parser, AST, and emitters currently fit together.

## Reference Material

- [CLI reference](../reference/cli.md) — subcommands, flags, and implementation status.
- [Grammar reference](../reference/grammar.md) — tokens, annotations, and component syntax supported today.
- [Configuration](../reference/config.md) — `raven.toml` layout and planned options.

## Additional Resources

- [Contributing](../contributing.md)
- [Changelog](../changelog.md)
- [Showcase roadmap](../../showcase-roadmap.md)

> ⚠️ RavensOne is pre-alpha software. Features described here reflect the current experimental implementation and may change rapidly.
