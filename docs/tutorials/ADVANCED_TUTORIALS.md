# Advanced Tutorials Roadmap

These tutorials expand on the quick start and focus on production-grade
workflows. Each tutorial includes runnable `.raven` code, step-by-step
explanations, and troubleshooting tips.

| Tutorial | Summary | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `01-authentication-strategies` | Multi-factor auth, social login, SSO, and session hardening patterns. | ‚úÖ Drafted |
| `02-data-modeling` | Designing relational + document schemas with migrations. | ‚úÖ Drafted |
| `03-real-time-collaboration` | WebSockets, CRDTs, optimistic UI, and offline sync. | üöß In progress |
| `04-operations` | Observability, logging, tracing, and error budgets. | üöß In progress |
| `05-deployment-deep-dive` | Blue/green deploys, preview branches, and Terraform automation. | üìù Planned |
