# Performance Optimization Pass (Pre v1.0)

We are executing a focused performance pass ahead of the v1.0 launch.

## Goals

- Reduce cold compile time below 10µs
- Lower generated bundle size by another 20%
- Cut server RPC latency (p95) under 45ms
- Add automated regression detection in CI

## Workstreams

### 1. Compiler Profiling
- Instrument lexer + parser hotspots with tracing spans
- Benchmark borrow checker allocations with flamegraph snapshots
- Inline critical tight loops in the code splitter and JS emitter

### 2. Runtime Optimizations
- Switch RPC serialization to a zero-copy binary format
- Pool WebSocket connections and reuse TLS sessions
- Add caching layer for frequently requested static assets

### 3. Build Pipeline
- Enable incremental WASM compilation artifacts in the CLI cache
- Parallelize minifier + bundler steps using worker threads
- Ship `raven bench` command for continuous benchmarking

### 4. Observability
- Publish Grafana dashboards for compiler + runtime metrics
- Configure alerting thresholds for latency regressions
- Capture diff-based bundle reports for every PR

## Timeline

- **Week 1** – Profiling instrumentation + baseline reports
- **Week 2** – Implement compiler + runtime fixes
- **Week 3** – Harden CI + add regression gates
- **Week 4** – Final tuning, documentation, and postmortem

## Acceptance Criteria

- All perf tests green for 7 consecutive nightly runs
- Bundle comparison report checked into `/dist/reports`
- Updated documentation in `docs/engineering/performance.md`
