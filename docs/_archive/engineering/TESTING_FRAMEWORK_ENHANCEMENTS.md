# Testing Framework Enhancements

We are upgrading the RavensOne testing story with utilities, E2E coverage, and
monitoring hooks.

## Objectives

- Provide batteries-included test utilities for server + client logic
- Introduce full E2E suites that run compiled bundles in headless browsers
- Pipe test telemetry into observability stack for flake detection

## Deliverables

1. **Testing Utilities Package**
   - `raven-test` crate with helpers for RPC mocking + fixture loading
   - DOM testing helpers for client code (`render`, `fire_event`)
   - Snapshot assertions for generated JS + WASM artifacts

2. **E2E Runner**
   - Playwright harness wired into `raven test --e2e`
   - Example coverage for todo, blog, commerce, chat apps
   - Parallel execution support with sharding across CI agents

3. **Monitoring Hooks**
   - Emit structured JSON logs for every test case
   - Push metrics (`duration`, `failures`, `retries`) to Prometheus
   - Alert when flake rate exceeds 2% rolling average

## Timeline

- **Week 1** – Ship `raven-test` utilities + documentation
- **Week 2** – Land E2E runner with example suites
- **Week 3** – Integrate telemetry + dashboards
- **Week 4** – Stabilization + polish

## Acceptance Criteria

- CLI command `raven test --watch` with instant feedback loop
- At least one golden snapshot per example application
- Flake dashboard live in Grafana with 30-day retention
