# Conference Talk: Building Full-Stack Apps in One File

**Event**: FutureStack SF 2025  •  **Speaker**: Eirene S.  •  **Slot**: Dec 12 @ 10:00 AM

## Abstract

Developers are drowning in boilerplate. This talk demonstrates how RavensOne
compiles a single `.raven` file into production-grade client, server, and WASM
artifacts. We walk through real-world apps—todo, blog, commerce, chat—and share
lessons from shipping the compiler bridge.

## Outline (30 Minutes)

1. **State of Modern Full-Stack Development** (5 min)
   - Toolchain sprawl, context switching, and onboarding cost
2. **Introducing RavensOne** (5 min)
   - Language overview, annotations, RPC bridge
3. **Live Demo: Todo App with Auth + Real-Time** (8 min)
   - Auth handshake, CRUD, subscription updates
4. **Deep Dive: Compiler Architecture** (6 min)
   - Lexer → Parser → Code splitter → RPC generator → JS emitter
5. **Case Studies** (4 min)
   - Blog platform, commerce store, real-time chat
6. **What’s Next** (2 min)
   - Mobile/desktop targets, serverless edge deployments
