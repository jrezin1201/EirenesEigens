## 🔬 Technical Details

### Reactive System Architecture

```
User Click → Event Handler → signal.set() → Notify Subscribers → Effect Runs → DOM Updates
```

### Signal Operations

```javascript
// Create signal
const count = new Signal(0);

// Read value (tracks dependency)
const value = count.get();

// Update value (triggers effects)
count.set(5);

// Update with function
count.update(v => v + 1);
```

### Effect Auto-Tracking

```javascript
new Effect(() => {
    // This effect will re-run whenever count changes
    const value = count.get();
    display.textContent = value;
});
```

## 💡 Tips

### Best Demo to Show
Start with **demo-counter.html** - it's the most polished and impressive!

### For Technical Audience
Use **demo-wasm-counter.html** - shows both systems side-by-side

### For Debugging
Use **test-reactive.html** - has detailed logging and status

### Quick WASM Check
Use **test-wasm.html** - simple and fast

---
