## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Type Inference Implementation**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Unification algorithm requires careful occurs check to prevent infinite types
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Matching AST structure is critical - read actual AST before implementing type checker
   - ✅ **Lesson**: RefCell management needs attention to avoid borrow conflicts

2. **Reactive State Management**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Automatic dependency tracking is powerful but requires careful context management
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Fine-grained reactivity outperforms Virtual DOM for frequent updates
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Test design must avoid triggering reactivity during effect execution

3. **JSX Parsing**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Lookahead for consecutive tokens enables natural bare text syntax
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Simplifying VNode enum (removing Fragment) reduced complexity without losing functionality

4. **Animation System**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Spring physics calculations are complex but provide natural, organic motion
   - ✅ **Lesson**: CSS generation from animation configs enables seamless integration with existing styles

5. **Deployment Infrastructure**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Comprehensive documentation is as important as code
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Build scripts simplify .raven → WASM workflow significantly
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Manual steps (like Vercel login) need clear documentation

### Process Insights

1. **Development Approach**:
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Incremental feature completion maintains momentum
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Writing tests alongside implementation catches issues early
   - ✅ **Lesson**: Regular documentation updates prevent knowledge loss

2. **Project Management**:
